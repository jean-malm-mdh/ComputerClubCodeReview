# Computer Club Code Review
This template project shall be used to upload a project that is to be code reviewed during the sessions in computer club.

# Steps
1) Clone the repository to your local workspace
2) Add your project to the repository. 
3) Push it to the remote project in the github classroom repository. 

# Utilities
To reduce the uploading of unnecessary files, please create a .gitignore file for your project. Typical things to ignore are cache and build directories.

If you wish to demonstrate the project live, there will be a Makefile in the template project with instructions on how to edit it to smooth the build and run process of the project.
* The makefile comes prepared with template code for the `build`, `run` and `clean` commands. Please add the necessary commands to perform those actions.
